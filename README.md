<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a former CDH Specialist with a background in Customer Service, Team Management, Learning & Development, and Bank Operations. The many roles I have served in have allowed me to develop and hone diverse skills such as problem-solving, communication, leadership, and much more.

In 2022 I decided to take the leap and pursue my dream of becoming a Software Engineer. BloomTech Institute of Technology has been an incredible journey thus far, and has taught me fundamentals to take the reigns on an exciting new career path!</p>
